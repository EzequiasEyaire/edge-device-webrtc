# WebRTC Browser Client Example

This client example can be used to make WebRTC connections to the webrtc-demo-device. It is designed as a sandbox in that it mimics the underlying library features instead of the features of the device application. This way, this example can also be used to test your own WebRTC device applications. For convenience, the example implements buttons to automatically fill in CoAP requests supported by the demo device.

## Usage

From this folder install the javascript dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then open the `index.html` file in a browser eg.:

```
file:///PATH/TO/REPO/ROOT/examples/webrtc-demo/web-client/index.html
```
